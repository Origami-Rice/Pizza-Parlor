Pair Programming (13.5/15):
The report contained some good reflections on what went well and not well in the process.
It would be also nice to also talk about what can be done better next time in terms of pair programming.

Program design (17/20):
The report briefly talked about the design patterns used in the program (Factory method and chain of responsibility).
The program design is good in general.

Functionality (24/25):
Have simple input error checking against wrong inputs.
CLI is mostly easy to use and all the functionality that were tested worked. It would be better if user doesn't have to type all the selections (e.g. use a numbering system) or they can pick using up/down arrows.

Tests (16/20):
Could not run the tests to see the coverage since dependency installation failed.

Code Craftsmanship (7/10):
There are some comments included for some of the functions explaining their usage.
The coding style looks clean and consistent.
The report didn't mention the tools being used for development.

md explanation and organization (8/10):
The readme file included good set of instructions on how to run and test the program.
Have some trouble installing all the dependencies from the requirements.txt file, but could run the cli.
